  Run ```npm start``` from the project root directory.
  This will load your server on http://localhost:3000

## Develop
1. Open another session in terminal, and use the command below to start express server with ```nodemon``` and:

      Run ```npm run dev1``` or ```npm run dev-server``` from the project root directory.
      This will load your server on http://localhost:3000

2. Use ```nodemon``` and ```webpack``` and ```Browsersync``` to pack the client js:

      Run ```npm run dev2``` or ```npm run dev-webpack``` from the project root directory.
      Browsersync will load your server on http://localhost:3100
